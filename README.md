## Introduction to Strategic Workforce Planning 
In today's fast-paced world, companies need to plan for a workforce that can adapt quickly. Things like new technologies, job market changes, weather and climate trends, and taxes can impact how long employees stay with a company. Planning for a strong and flexible workforce helps companies deal with these issues and keep their competitive edge.

The project aims to examine the factors disrupting employee retention and workforce resilience in the future. It employs trend analysis to assess the current state, scenario analysis to explore how companies can respond to disruptive elements, and sensitivity analysis to predict future outcomes.

The outcome of the project is the development of a "resilience score" calculator. This tool measures a company's readiness to address these challenges and offers strategic insights for building a robust, adaptable workforce tailored to specific industry needs. This could be a game-changer for businesses aiming to future-proof their HR strategies. As we navigate this ever-changing landscape, we're proud to provide a resource that empowers businesses to stay ahead of the curve, ensuring they're equipped to handle whatever the future may bring.
