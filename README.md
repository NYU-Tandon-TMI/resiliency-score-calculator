## Introduction to Strategic Workforce Planning 
In today's fast-paced world, companies need to plan for a workforce that can adapt quickly. Things like new technologies, job market changes, weather and climate trends, and taxes can impact how long employees stay with a company. Planning for a strong and flexible workforce helps companies deal with these issues and keep their competitive edge.

The project aims to examine the factors disrupting employee retention and workforce resilience in the future. It employs trend analysis to assess the current state, scenario analysis to explore how companies can respond to disruptive elements, and sensitivity analysis to predict future outcomes.

The outcome of the project is the development of a "resilience score" calculator. This tool measures a company's readiness to address these challenges and offers strategic insights for building a robust, adaptable workforce tailored to specific industry needs. This could be a game-changer for businesses aiming to future-proof their HR strategies. As we navigate this ever-changing landscape, we're proud to provide a resource that empowers businesses to stay ahead of the curve, ensuring they're equipped to handle whatever the future may bring.

## Trend Analysis
Trend analysis investigates five key factors influencing workforce planning, which encompass rapid changes in the labor market, particularly work arrangements, technological advancements in AI adoption, weather and climate patterns, tax burdens, and the occurrence of natural disasters.

### 1. Labor Market Trends in Workplace Arrangement
Six in 10 employees with remote-capable jobs prefer a hybrid work arrangement due to factors like flexibility, work-life balance, and reduced commuting, while one-third favor fully remote work for reasons such as a quiet workspace or fewer distractions.

### 2. Technology Trends and Advancements in AI Adoption
Artificial Intelligence is predicted to lead the market by 2026, surpassing the Metaverse after an initial surge in the first four years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid development of generative AI technologies like ChatGPT, Dall-E, and MidJourney drives its market dominance, while the Metaverse's growth is influenced by remote work, virtual communication, and emerging economic opportunities, like NFTs and blockchain.

### 3. Tax Implications 
<b> a. Tax Burdens </b>
Tax burden disparities across U.S. states significantly influence employment rates, flow-in and flow-out ratios, and talent retention. Research indicates that states with lower tax rates tend to retain employees more effectively, as tax burdens heavily impact individuals' decisions on where to work. States with higher tax burdens generally experience higher unemployment rates, influencing people's decisions on where to work and live. Tax burdens also impact businesses' decisions on where to operate.

<b> b. In-To-Out Ratio </b>
States with higher tax burdens generally have lower in-to-out ratios, reducing ability to attract talent. For example, New York's 12.47% tax burden results in a 0.72 in-to-out ratio, while Florida's 6.33% tax burden yields a higher ratio of 1.6. By encouraging talent to seek opportunities in states with lower taxes, they significantly impact talent attraction and retention.

### 4. Weather (Temperature)
The data indicates that warmer states typically have higher employment rates than colder ones, with a 65°F average temperature for the top five states compared to 30°F for the lowest five. This trend could prompt workers to favor warmer states with more job opportunities and companies to establish headquarters in such locations. 

### 5. The Occurrence of Natural Disasters
The rise in climate change-related natural disasters, such as wildfires in North America, is driving people and businesses to colder, lower-risk regions, potentially leading to reduced employment and job retention in warmer areas. As businesses grow more concerned about climate change's impact on operations, they are relocating to safer areas, while employees seek more stable environments. As a result, employment and job incumbency rates may decline in warmer regions and increase in colder areas.

## Scenario Planning 
The scenario planning focuses on establishing the baseline and weighted factors, which vary significantly depending on the industry. After setting up both, the project calculates the resilience score for two dummy companies operating in different industries. Here are the steps we took for scenario planning:
- Setting up the Baseline : define the baseline and categories of all factors as a starting point for analyzing outcomes
- Setting the Baseline Score
